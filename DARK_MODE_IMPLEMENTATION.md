# Dark Mode Implementation

## Overview

The dark mode implementation has been successfully updated to work across all pages of the website with proper state persistence.

## Key Features

### ✅ **Cross-Page Compatibility**
- Dark mode now works on all pages: main (`/`), studio (`/studio`), content pages (`/content/[category]/[slug]`), and theme demo (`/theme-demo`)
- All pages use consistent theme-aware CSS classes instead of hardcoded colors

### ✅ **State Persistence**
- User's theme preference is automatically saved to localStorage using `next-themes`
- Theme preference persists across browser sessions and page navigation
- Supports three modes: Light, Dark, and System (follows OS preference)

### ✅ **Consistent Navigation**
- All pages now include a unified Navigation component with theme toggle
- Theme toggle is accessible from every page in the top navigation

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture
1. **Theme Provider**: Uses `next-themes` library with proper configuration in root layout
2. **CSS Variables**: All styling uses CSS variables that automatically change based on theme
3. **Shared Navigation**: Consistent navigation component across all pages
4. **Theme Toggle**: Available on all pages with three-state cycling (Light → Dark → System → Light)

### Key Components

#### 1. Navigation Component (`components/navigation.tsx`)
- Unified navigation bar with theme toggle
- Used across all pages for consistency
- Shows current page state

#### 2. Theme Provider (`components/theme-provider.tsx`)
- Wraps the entire app in root layout
- Configured with:
  - `attribute="class"` - Uses CSS classes for theme switching
  - `defaultTheme="system"` - Defaults to system preference
  - `enableSystem` - Supports system theme detection
  - `disableTransitionOnChange` - Prevents flash during SSR

#### 3. Theme Toggle (`components/theme-toggle.tsx`)
- Provides both dropdown and switch variants
- Handles SSR hydration properly
- Cycles through Light → Dark → System modes

### CSS Implementation

#### Global CSS Variables (`app/globals.css`)
- Light and dark theme variables defined
- CSS classes like `.bg-pattern`, `.bg-grid`, `.gradient-accent` adapt to theme
- Uses semantic color tokens: `bg-background`, `text-foreground`, `text-muted-foreground`

#### Before vs After

**Before (Hardcoded Dark):**
```tsx
<div className="min-h-screen bg-zinc-950 text-zinc-100">
  <span className="text-zinc-300">Content</span>
</div>
```

**After (Theme-Aware):**
```tsx
<div className="min-h-screen bg-background text-foreground bg-pattern bg-grid">
  <span className="text-muted-foreground">Content</span>
</div>
```

## Pages Updated

1. **Main Page** (`app/page.tsx`) - ✅ Updated to use Navigation component
2. **Studio Page** (`app/studio/page.tsx`) - ✅ Converted from hardcoded dark to theme-aware
3. **Content Pages** (`app/content/[category]/[slug]/page.tsx`) - ✅ Converted from hardcoded dark to theme-aware  
4. **Theme Demo Page** (`app/theme-demo/page.tsx`) - ✅ Added Navigation component

## Testing

The implementation has been tested and verified:
- ✅ Development server runs successfully
- ✅ All pages render correctly with theme support
- ✅ Theme toggle appears on all pages
- ✅ CSS variables are properly applied
- ✅ next-themes script is included in HTML output
- ✅ Theme persistence is handled by next-themes library

## Usage

Users can now:
1. Toggle between Light/Dark/System modes from any page
2. Have their preference remembered across sessions
3. Enjoy consistent theming across the entire website
4. Benefit from automatic system theme detection

The dark mode implementation is now complete and fully functional across all pages!
